# IMDb-Movies-and-TV-Shows
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the success of movies and TV shows based on data from IMDb (Internet Movie Database). The goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate the rating, popularity, or success of a movie/TV show using features such as genre, cast, director, runtime, release year, and more.
Key Features
Data Collection:

Scrape or download IMDb datasets (e.g., movies, TV shows, ratings, reviews).

Include features like title, genre, cast, director, runtime, release year, and user ratings.

Data Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess the data (e.g., handle missing values, encode categorical variables).

Perform feature engineering (e.g., extract keywords, calculate average ratings).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize trends in movie/TV show ratings, genres, and release years.

Analyze the relationship between features (e.g., runtime vs. rating).

Predictive Modeling:

Build machine learning models to predict:

IMDb rating (regression).

Success (e.g., binary classification for high/low ratings).

Evaluate models using metrics like RMSE, MAE, or accuracy.

Deployment:

Deploy the model as a web application or API for users to predict ratings.
